# Teacher Induction Log - Tasks

## Recently Completed ✅

### JSON_CLOB Format Implementation (June 10, 2025)
- ✅ **Implemented JSON_CLOB parsing** in `formStore.ts` with `parseFormConfig()` and `isJsonClobFormat()` functions
- ✅ **Added backward compatibility** for legacy JSON format
- ✅ **Updated PowerSchool configuration files** for JSON_CLOB format:
  - Admin SQL query: `JSON_ARRAYAGG(JSON_OBJECT('JSON_CLOB' VALUE json_clob))`
  - Teacher config: Converted to escaped JSON string format
- ✅ **Enhanced App.svelte** for automatic JSON_CLOB format detection and parsing
- ✅ **Added comprehensive test coverage** (8 new tests for JSON_CLOB functionality)
- ✅ **Verified production build** and deployment compatibility
- ✅ **Updated documentation** (MERMAID.md, README.md) with JSON_CLOB architecture details
- ✅ **220 tests passing** with 84.44% code coverage
- ✅ **Type safety implementation** with `JsonClobEntry` and `RawFormConfig` interfaces

### Next Major Refactor
- Updated `GenericSection.svelte` to use centralized `canEdit()` function for all field permissions

- Replace nested editability booleans and duplicated role logic with a single centralized `canEdit(role, sectionId, fieldKey)` function
- Use this function throughout the UI to determine field editability
- Remove `editable` and `verifications` nested objects
- Simplify `GenericSection.svelte` and other components to call `canEdit()` directly
- Make permissions composable and override-friendly
- Add tests for `canEdit()` covering all roles, sections, and fields
- Document permission rules clearly in one place

## Current Tasks

### High Priority - Mentor Workflow Implementation
- [ ] **Create Mentor Dashboard HTML page** (`/teachers/mentor-dashboard/mentor-dashboard.html`)
- [ ] **Create Mentor Dashboard Svelte component** for selecting mentees
- [ ] **Update Page Cataloging** to include mentor dashboard navigation
- [ ] **Implement Mentee Data Endpoint** for fetching mentor's assigned mentees
- [ ] **Add Mentor View Mode** to existing teacher-induction-log page
- [ ] **Update Custom Element** to handle mentor view parameters (mentee ID, view mode)
- [ ] **Test Mentor Permissions** ensure mentors can only edit verification fields
- [ ] **Create Mentor Navigation Flow** from dashboard → mentee log → back to dashboard
- [ ] **PowerSchool Integration** for mentor-mentee relationships and data fetching

### High Priority - General
- [ ] Improve test coverage (current coverage: 84.44% statements, target: 90%)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve accessibility features across all components
- [ ] Enhance error handling and user feedback messages
- [ ] Optimize bundle size to improve loading performance
- [ ] Document component API for better maintainability
- [ ] Update form styling to match latest design guidelines
- [ ] Fix date picker display issues in Firefox browsers
- [ ] Resolve shadow DOM styling conflicts with certain components

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Create animated transitions between form sections
- [ ] Add support for file attachments (certificates, etc.)
- [ ] Implement data export to CSV/Excel format
- [ ] Address form submission failures on slow network connections
- [ ] Fix printing layout issues with tables spanning multiple pages
- [ ] Create user guide for teachers and administrators

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Separate UI logic from data management in components
- [ ] Standardize event handling across components
- [ ] Create proper error boundaries for component failures

## Test Coverage Summary (June 10, 2025)
