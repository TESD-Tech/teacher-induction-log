# Teacher Induction Log - Tasks

### Next Major Refactor
- Updated `GenericSection.svelte` to use centralized `canEdit()` function for all field permissions

- Replace nested editability booleans and duplicated role logic with a single centralized `canEdit(role, sectionId, fieldKey)` function
- Use this function throughout the UI to determine field editability
- Remove `editable` and `verifications` nested objects
- Simplify `GenericSection.svelte` and other components to call `canEdit()` directly
- Make permissions composable and override-friendly
- Add tests for `canEdit()` covering all roles, sections, and fields
- Document permission rules clearly in one place

## Current Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Improve test coverage (current coverage: ~80.5% of statements, target: 90%)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Improve accessibility features across all components
- [ ] Enhance error handling and user feedback messages
- [ ] Optimize bundle size to improve loading performance
- [ ] Document component API for better maintainability
- [ ] Update form styling to match latest design guidelines
- [ ] Fix date picker display issues in Firefox browsers
- [ ] Resolve shadow DOM styling conflicts with certain components

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Create animated transitions between form sections
- [ ] Add support for file attachments (certificates, etc.)
- [ ] Implement data export to CSV/Excel format
- [ ] Address form submission failures on slow network connections
- [ ] Fix printing layout issues with tables spanning multiple pages
- [ ] Create user guide for teachers and administrators

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Separate UI logic from data management in components
- [ ] Standardize event handling across components
- [ ] Create proper error boundaries for component failures
