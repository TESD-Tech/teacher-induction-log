# Teacher Induction Log - Implementation Notes

## Overview
The Teacher Induction Log is a Svelte 5 application that uses web components to create a form for tracking teacher induction activities. It's built with TypeScript and uses the Shadow DOM for style encapsulation.

## Key Components

### Architecture
- Uses custom elements via the Web Components API
- Implements Shadow DOM for style isolation
- Built with Svelte 5 and TypeScript
- Uses a store-based state management pattern

### File Structure
- `custom-element.ts` - Defines the main web component
- `lib-components.ts` - Automatically registers components from the lib directory
- `main.ts` - Entry point that imports and initializes everything
- `formStore.ts` - State management for the form data
- `sectionConfigs.ts` - Configuration for different form sections

### Implementation Achievements
- Successfully implemented Web Components with Shadow DOM
- Created reactive form with role-based permissions
- Integrated Carbon Design System icons
- Implemented automatic component registration
- Added form validation and auto-save functionality
- Created print-optimized stylesheets
- Set up testing framework for Svelte 5 components

## UI & Styling

### Design Choices
- Modified background color to a softer cream (#F8F1E5)
- Enhanced table styling with proper borders, padding and alignment
- Improved form layout with consistent spacing and typography
- Implemented responsive design for all device sizes
- Added print-specific stylesheets for PDF generation

### UI Components
- ActivityTable - For displaying and editing tabular data with add/remove functionality
- ActionsBar - Provides consistent actions like save and print
- FormSection - Reusable container for form sections
- InputField - Standardized input field with label and validation

### Styling Best Practices
- Use CSS variables for consistent colors and spacing
- Apply Shadow DOM compatible styles
- Keep table layouts fixed for predictable column widths
- Use proper contrast ratios for text readability
- Maintain consistent padding and spacing throughout the UI

## Data Management

### Form Data Structure
The application manages data for:
- Teacher information (inductee, building, assignment)
- Summer Academy participation (4 pre-defined days)
- Induction Seminars (4 pre-defined seminars)
- Mentor Meetings (dynamic number of entries)
- Team Meetings (dynamic number of entries)
- Classroom Visits (dynamic number of entries)
- Other Professional Activities (dynamic number of entries)
- Signatures and verification

### State Management
- Central form store using Svelte's writable stores
- Helper functions for common operations (add/remove entries)
- Support for different user roles with appropriate permissions
- Configuration loading from external JSON

## User Roles

### Teacher Role
- Can edit most form fields
- Cannot edit verification fields
- Primary user for data entry

### Admin Role
- Full editing capabilities including verification fields
- Can approve and verify teacher activities
- Administrative oversight of the induction process

## Web Component Integration

### Custom Element Implementation
The application wraps Svelte components as Web Components, which allows them to be embedded in any HTML page with proper style encapsulation. This is achieved through:
- Creating Shadow DOM for style isolation
- Injecting global styles into the shadow root
- Passing properties through attributes

### Integration Usage
To integrate this component into another system:
1. Include the compiled JS (from the `dist` directory)
2. Add the custom element tag: `<teacher-induction-log-app></teacher-induction-log-app>`
3. Provide configuration via attributes:
   ```html
   <teacher-induction-log-app 
     data="[JSON string]" 
     editable="[JSON string]" 
     user-role="admin">
   </teacher-induction-log-app>
   ```

## PowerSchool Integration

### Directory Structure
The PowerSchool integration uses a specific directory structure:
```
WEB_ROOT/
├── admin/
│   ├── faculty/
│   └── teacher-induction-log/
└── teachers/
    └── teacher-induction-log/
```

### Configuration
- JSON configuration file needs to be accessible at runtime
- Different configurations based on user role
- The application automatically detects PowerSchool environment

## Development Notes

### Package Management
- Use `pnpm` for package management
- Version is set to 25.04.01 (YY.MM.PATCH)

### Component Development
- Components in `lib/` are automatically registered as web components
- Carbon icons must be imported directly from lib folder: `import Add from "carbon-icons-svelte/lib/Add.svelte"`
- Form stores provide centralized state management

### Testing
- Use Testing Library for component testing
- Current test coverage: 50.5%
- Target test coverage: 80%
- Fix incompatibilities with Svelte 5 testing

## Next Steps

### Current Priorities
- Improve form header layout to reduce blank space
- Increase test coverage to 80%
- Fix lib-components.ts test coverage (currently 0%)
- Refactor formStore.ts to improve type safety

### Future Enhancements
- Add data export capabilities (PDF, Excel)
- Create administrator dashboard
- Implement file attachment support
- Add advanced filtering and search capabilities
