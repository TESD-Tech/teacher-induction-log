# Plan to Achieve 100% Test Coverage

## **Step 1: Analyze Current Coverage**
1. **Review Coverage Report**:
   - Use the `coverage/index.html` file to identify files and components with low or no test coverage.
   - Focus on critical components and utilities first, such as:
     - `src/lib/components/ui/`
     - `src/lib/stores/`
     - `src/lib/utils.ts`

2. **Categorize Files**:
   - **High Priority**: Core components and utilities (e.g., `Button.svelte`, `DateInput.svelte`, `Select.svelte`, `formStore.ts`).
   - **Medium Priority**: Supporting components (e.g., `FormRow.svelte`, `LogSection.svelte`).
   - **Low Priority**: Configuration files and less critical sections.

---

## **Step 2: Define Testing Goals**
1. **Test Types**:
   - **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions, methods, and components.
   - **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components (e.g., `Button` and `FormRow`).
   - **End-to-End Tests**: Validate user flows (e.g., form submission).

2. **Coverage Metrics**:
   - **Statements**: 100%
   - **Branches**: 100%
   - **Functions**: 100%
   - **Lines**: 100%

---

## **Step 3: Task Breakdown**
1. **Component Testing**:
   - Write or improve tests for each component in `src/lib/components/ui/`.
   - Example:
     - `Button.svelte`: Test all props, events, and edge cases.
     - `DateInput.svelte`: Validate date formatting and error handling.

2. **Utility Testing**:
   - Add tests for `src/lib/utils.ts` to cover all utility functions.

3. **Store Testing**:
   - Test `formStore.ts` and `saveManager.ts` for state management and persistence logic.

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components (e.g., `FormRow` with `Button`).

5. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Use a framework like Cypress or Playwright to test user flows.

---

## **Step 4: Implement Testing Improvements**
1. **Enhance Test Setup**:
   - Review `src/tests/setup.ts` for any missing configurations.
   - Add mocks and stubs for external dependencies.

2. **Write Missing Tests**:
   - Focus on untested files identified in the coverage report.

3. **Refactor for Testability**:
   - Refactor tightly coupled components to make them easier to test.

---

## **Step 5: Continuous Integration**
1. **Integrate Coverage Checks**:
   - Update the CI pipeline to enforce 100% coverage thresholds.

2. **Automate Reporting**:
   - Generate and share coverage reports after each build.

---

## **Step 6: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**
1. **Update `TESTING.md`**:
   - Add guidelines for writing and maintaining tests.

2. **Conduct Workshops**:
   - Train team members on testing best practices.
