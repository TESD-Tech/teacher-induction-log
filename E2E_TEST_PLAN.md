**Plan: Automate Verification with Playwright E2E Tests**

This plan outlines the steps to implement End-to-End (E2E) tests using Playwright to automate the verification of data migration, responsive behavior, and user role permissions for the "Year 1 Initials" and "Year 2 Initials" feature.

## Phase 1: Playwright Setup

1.  **Install Playwright**:
    *   Add Playwright to the project dependencies.
    *   Install necessary browser binaries.
    *   Update `package.json` with a script to run Playwright tests.

## Phase 2: Data Migration E2E Test

1.  **Prepare Old Data**:
    *   Create a mock data file representing the application state with the "old" `verification` field. This file will be served during the test.
2.  **Write E2E Test**:
    *   Launch the application in a Playwright browser.
    *   Intercept the data loading request and serve the mock "old" data.
    *   Wait for the application to render.
    *   Assert that the "Year 1 Initials" and "Year 2 Initials" fields in the UI correctly display the migrated data from the `verification` field.

## Phase 3: Responsive Behavior E2E Tests

1.  **Define Viewports**:
    *   Identify key viewport sizes for responsive testing (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
2.  **Write Responsive Tests**:
    *   For each viewport size:
        *   Set the browser viewport to the specified dimensions.
        *   Navigate to the relevant page containing the new columns.
        *   Assert that the layout of the table and the new "Year 1 Initials" and "Year 2 Initials" columns adapts as expected (e.g., checking element visibility, CSS properties like `display`, `width`, or `flex-direction`).

## Phase 4: User Role Permissions E2E Tests

1.  **Prepare User Credentials**:
    *   Ensure mock credentials or a mechanism to simulate logins for `admin`, `mentor`, and `mentee` roles are available.
2.  **Write Role-Specific Tests**:
    *   For each user role:
        *   Log in as the specific user role.
        *   Navigate to a page containing the "Year 1 Initials" and "Year 2 Initials" fields.
        *   Attempt to interact with these fields (e.g., type into them).
        *   Assert that the fields are editable (e.g., `isEditable()`) or read-only (e.g., `isDisabled()` or checking for the presence of a read-only class) according to the permissions defined in `permissions.ts`.

## Phase 5: Integration with CI/CD (Optional but Recommended)

1.  **Add to CI/CD Pipeline**:
    *   Configure the project's CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run Playwright tests on every push or pull request. This ensures continuous verification of the feature.
