# Teacher Induction Log - Project Planning

## Project Overview
The Teacher Induction Log is a web application designed to track and manage teacher induction programs. It provides a structured approach to documenting a new teacher's professional development journey during their first two years, including various activities, meetings, and professional development sessions.

## Goals and Objectives
1. Create a user-friendly digital form for tracking teacher induction activities
2. Support different user roles (teachers and administrators) with appropriate access controls
3. Ensure data can be easily saved, retrieved, and printed
4. Integrate seamlessly with PowerSchool or as a standalone web application
5. Provide a responsive design that works well on all device sizes
6. Ensure accessibility compliance for all users

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Svelte 5
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Component Architecture**: Web Components (Custom Elements)
- **CSS Methodology**: Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- **Icons**: Carbon Design System (carbon-icons-svelte)
- **Testing**: Vitest with Testing Library

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- Web Component architecture with Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- Centralized form store for state management
- Carbon Design System icons integration
- Responsive UI design
- Form section components (CoverPage, Activities, Signatures)
- Auto-save functionality
- Date input validation
- Print stylesheets for PDF generation
- Basic testing framework

### In Progress
- Improving test coverage (current: ~50.5%)
- Refining form header layout
- Enhancing accessibility features
- Component API documentation

### Planned
- Data export functionality (CSV/Excel)
- Enhanced printing capabilities
- File attachment support
- Administrator dashboard

## Architecture

### Component Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture using Svelte 5 with Web Components:

1. **Custom Elements Layer**
   - Provides the public API for embedding the application
   - Manages Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
   - Handles attribute changes and property updates

2. **Application Layer**
   - Main application component (App.svelte)
   - Handles configuration loading and initialization
   - Routes to the appropriate components

3. **Feature Components Layer**
   - Specialized components for different sections of the form
   - Reusable UI components for consistent interface elements

4. **State Management Layer**
   - Centralized form store using Svelte's built-in stores
   - Helper functions for data manipulation and actions

└── App.svelte              # Main application component
```

## Data Model

### Form Data Structure
The application manages a comprehensive form with the following main sections:
- Cover page information (inductee, building, assignment, etc.)
- Summer Academy participation
- Induction Seminars
- Mentor Meetings
- Team Meetings
- Classroom Visits
- Other Professional Activities
- Signatures

### State Management
- `formStore.ts` contains the primary state management logic
- Uses Svelte's writable stores for reactive updates
- Implements helper functions for common operations (add/remove entries)
- Maintains form data, editability state, and user role information

## User Roles and Permissions
1. **Teacher Role**
   - Can edit most form fields
   - Cannot edit verification fields (restricted to admins)
   - Primary user for data entry

2. **Admin Role**
   - Full editing capabilities including verification fields
   - Can approve and verify teacher activities
   - Administrative oversight of the induction process

## Implementation Strategy

### Web Component Integration
The application is implemented as a custom element (Web Component) that can be embedded in any HTML page:
```html
<teacher-induction-log-app></teacher-induction-log-app>
```

The component accepts the following attributes:
- `data`: JSON string containing form data
- `editable`: JSON string defining which fields can be edited
- `user-role`: String specifying the user role ('teacher' or 'admin')

### Shadow DOM for Style Encapsulation
- All styles are encapsulated using Shadow DOM
- Global styles are manually injected into the shadow root
- Component-specific styles use Svelte's scoped styling

### PowerSchool Integration
The application is designed to integrate with PowerSchool through:
- HTML pages in the PowerSchool admin/teacher directories
- Configuration JSON files stored in PowerSchool web directories
- Appropriate navigation and page categorization

## Development Workflow

### Development Environment
- Use `pnpm` as the package manager
- Run development server with `pnpm dev`
- Test components with `pnpm test`
- Build for production with `pnpm build`

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Focus on critical user interactions and data management
- Test both component rendering and state updates
- Use Testing Library for component testing
- Current test coverage: 50.5%
- Target test coverage: 80%

### Code Style and Conventions
- TypeScript for type safety and improved development experience
- Consistent component naming: PascalCase for components
- File naming: Component files match component names
- Use interfaces for data structures and props
- Prefer functional programming patterns when appropriate
- Document complex functions and components

## Deployment Process
1. Build the application with `pnpm build`
2. Deploy the compiled files to the appropriate web server directory
3. For PowerSchool integration, place files in the PowerSchool web directory structure
4. Ensure configuration files are properly located and accessible

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement auto-save functionality (Completed: April 3, 2025)
2. Add export capabilities (PDF, Excel)
3. Create a dashboard for administrators to track multiple teachers
4. Enhance form validation and error feedback
5. Add multilingual support
6. Improve printing functionality with dedicated print styles (Completed: April 3, 2025)
7. Implement advanced filtering and search capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Optimize rendering of large tables
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Use efficient state update patterns

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes on all interactive elements
- Maintain appropriate color contrast
- Support keyboard navigation
- Provide text alternatives for visual elements
- Test with screen readers

### Browser Compatibility
- Target modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Use appropriate polyfills for Web Components as needed
- Test on a variety of devices and screen sizes

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user input
- Implement appropriate access controls based on user roles
- Use HTTPS for data transmission
- Follow security best practices for web applications
